              Difuse websites (collectively “difuse.io” in this document) refer to sites hosted on the difuse.io, forum.difuse.io, and other related domains and subdomains thereof. This h5rivacy policy describes how difuse.io uses and protects any information that you give us. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. If you provide us with personal information through difuse.io, you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.

            <h2 className='display-5'style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Website visitors</h2>
            <br></br>
            <h5 style={{ lineHeight: '1.6em' }}>Like most website operators, difuse.io collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. difuse.io's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how difuse.io's visitors use its website. From time to time, difuse.io may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</h5>
            <br></br>
            <h5 style={{ lineHeight: '1.6em' }}>difuse.io also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. difuse.io does not use IP addresses to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</h5>
            <br></br>

            <h2  className='display-5' style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Gathering of personally-identifying information</h2>
            <br></br>
            <h5 style={{ lineHeight: '1.6em' }}>
              Certain visitors to difuse.io choose to interact with difuse.io in ways that require difuse to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that difuse gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a username and email address.
            </h5>
            <br></br>
            <h5 style={{ lineHeight: '1.6em' }}>
              In each case, difuse.io collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with difuse.io. difuse.io does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities, like interacting with the forums.
            </h5>
            <br></br>
            <h5 style={{ lineHeight: '1.6em' }}>All of the information that is collected on difuse.io will be handled in accordance with GDPR legislation.</h5>

            <h2  className='display-5' style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Protection of certain personally-identifying information</h2>
            <br></br>
            <h5 style={{ lineHeight: '1.6em' }}>difuse.io discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of project administrators, employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on difuse.io's behalf or to provide services available through difuse.io, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using difuse.io, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.</h5>
            <br></br>
            <h5 style={{ lineHeight: '1.6em' }}>difuse.io will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to project administrators, employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, difuse.io discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, if you give permission to have your information shared, or when difuse.io believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of difuse.io, third parties, or the public at large.</h5>
            <br></br>
            <h5 style={{ lineHeight: '1.6em' }}>If you are a registered user of a difuse.io website and have supplied your email address, difuse.io may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with difuse.io and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.</h5>
            <br></br>
            <h5 style={{ lineHeight: '1.6em' }}>If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. difuse.io takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</h5>
            <br></br>

            <h2 className='display-5' style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Use of personal information</h2>

            <h5 style={{ lineHeight: '1.6em' }}>We will not use the information you provide when you register for an account, attend our events, receive newsletters, use certain other services, or participate in the Difuse project in any other way.</h5>
            <br></br>
            <h5 style={{ lineHeight: '1.6em' }}>We will not sell or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so.</h5>

            <h5 style={{ lineHeight: '1.6em' }}>We would like to send you email marketing communication which may be of interest to you from time to time. If you have consented to marketing, you may opt out later.</h5>
